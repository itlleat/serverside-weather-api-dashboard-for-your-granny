## Project Description
 
Welcome! This is a simple Web Application that allows you to enter the name of a city in the search bar and have the current date with weather information displayed and a five day forecast for the chosen city. The page will save the cities you've already searched and you can click on them to fetch the info again. The current and 5 day forecast will also display a weather badge icon reflecting the weather on that day.
